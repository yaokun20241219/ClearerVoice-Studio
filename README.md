<strong>ClearerVoice-Studio</strong> is an open-source toolkit for **speech enhancement**, **speech separation**, and <a href="https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/blob/main/train/target_speaker_extraction">**target speaker extraction**<a/>, for both researchers and developers in speech processing. The repo is organized into three main components: **[ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice)**, <a href="https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/speechscore">**speechscore**<a/>, and **train**, each tailored to specific needs.

Currently, the repo is under updating...

## Repository Structure

### 1. **clearvoice**  
The [`clearvoice`](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/clearvoice) folder contains pre-trained models trained on large datasets. These models are designed for inference and can be directly integrated into your projects.

### 2. **train**  
The `train` folder includes scripts and resources to train models for all three tasks:

- **Speech enhancement**
- **Speech separation**
- **[Target speaker extraction](train/target_speaker_extraction/README.md)**

### 3. **speechscore**  
The <a href="https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio/tree/main/speechscore">`speechscore`<a/> folder provides scripts to evaluate the quality of speech processed through the toolkit. It includes metrics and tools to assess:

- Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)
- Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI)
- Other relevant quality benchmarks  

These scripts help you quantify improvements in your speech processing pipeline.
